# 🔧 PostgreSQL Boolean Comparison Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The Railway deployment was showing a fatal error:

```
Fatal error: SQLSTATE[42883]: Undefined function: 7 ERROR: operator does not exist: boolean = integer
```

## ✅ **Root Cause**

PostgreSQL is strict about data type comparisons. Boolean fields cannot be compared with integers (1/0) like in MySQL. They must be compared with boolean values (`true`/`false`).

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **File: `home.php`**

✅ Fixed 5 boolean comparisons:

- `WHERE is_active = 1` → `WHERE is_active = true`
- `WHERE is_featured = 1` → `WHERE is_featured = true`
- `WHERE is_published = 1` → `WHERE is_published = true`

### **File: `api/admin-crud.php`**

✅ Fixed 4 boolean comparisons in database stats:

- `WHERE is_active = 1` → `WHERE is_active = true`

### **File: `testimonials.php`**

✅ Fixed 1 boolean comparison:

- `WHERE is_active = 1` → `WHERE is_active = true`

## ✅ **What Was NOT Changed**

- ✅ Insert/Update operations with `1`/`0` values (PostgreSQL accepts these)
- ✅ Toggle operations `? 0 : 1` (PostgreSQL accepts these for updates)
- ✅ PHP conditional logic `isset($_POST['field']) ? 1 : 0` (works fine)

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

- ✅ Railway deployment should now work without database errors
- ✅ Homepage should load with dynamic content from database
- ✅ Admin panel should function properly with all CRUD operations
- ✅ All database queries should execute successfully

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. Deploy the updated code to Railway
2. Test the homepage and admin functionality
3. Verify all database operations work correctly

The application should now be fully functional on Railway with proper PostgreSQL boolean handling!
